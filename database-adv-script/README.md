SQL QUERIES

INNER JOIN
The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

LEFT JOIN 
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

FULL OUTER JOIN 
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.
