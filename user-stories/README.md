## Description of User Stories

The user stories outline how different actors (Guest, Host, Admin, and Payment System) interact with the system.  
They describe the goals and actions from the userâ€™s perspective, ensuring the platform meets real needs.  
These stories guide the development process by showing what functionality is valuable to each type of user.
