Essence of the Use Case Diagram

The use case diagram illustrates how different actors (users and the system) interact with the Airbnb-like platform.  

Key Actors:
- **Guest** – Registers, searches for properties, books stays, makes payments, and leaves reviews.  
- **Host** – Registers, manages property listings, handles bookings, receives payments, and responds to reviews.  
- **Admin** – Oversees the entire system, including user management, property monitoring, and payment tracking.  
- **Payment Gateway** – Facilitates secure payment transactions.  

Overview

The use case diagram provides a high-level view of how different actors (guests, hosts, admins, and payment gateways) interact with the system.  
It highlights core functionalities such as user registration, property management, booking, payments, reviews, notifications, and admin oversight.
